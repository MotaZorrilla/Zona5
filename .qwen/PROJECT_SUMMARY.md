# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Fix the report generation system that was getting stuck at 20% progress due to timeout errors and improper asynchronous processing, and resolve various syntax errors in the controller file.

## Key Knowledge
- The system uses asynchronous task processing for PDF report generation
- The main issue was in `ReportController.php` where `processReportTask` was causing timeouts when called directly in HTTP requests
- The frontend uses a progress tracking system with real-time updates
- Laravel Jobs system is not fully configured, so alternative solutions were needed
- The file `seguimiento-progreso-reporte.js` handles frontend progress tracking
- The `AsyncTaskService.php` processes the actual report generation

## Recent Actions
- Fixed syntax error in `AsyncTaskService.php` where `RealTimeProgressTracker` was not properly referenced with namespace
- Improved error handling in `seguimiento-progreso-reporte.js` to handle non-JSON responses
- Fixed issue where process was stuck at 10% "Iniciando procesamiento..." by creating a new endpoint `/admin/reports/start-processing`
- Added new `startProcessing` method to `ReportController` to handle the actual report generation
- Modified frontend JavaScript to call the new endpoint when progress is stuck at 10%
- Added corresponding route in `web.php` for the new endpoint
- Fixed multiple syntax errors in `ReportController.php` including unmatched brackets and extra closing braces

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Identify and fix syntax errors in `ReportController.php`
2. [DONE] Resolve issue of report generation getting stuck at 10% progress
3. [DONE] Implement proper async processing for report generation
4. [DONE] Add error handling for JSON parsing issues in frontend
5. [DONE] Create a separate endpoint to handle heavy processing without blocking main requests
